#HASHING
Hashing is the process of generating a string, or hash, from a given message using a mathematical function known as a cryptographic hash function.
While there are several hash functions out there, those tailored to hashing functions need to have 4 main properties to be secure:
1. It should be deterministic: the same message processed by the same hash function should always produce the same hash.
2. It's not reversible: It's impractical to generate a message from its hash
3. It has high entropy: a small change to a message should produce a vastly different hash
4. It resist collissions: two different messages should not produce the same hash
